Think about conversational design. You dont want your user to say something and your bot doesn't have a response Think about the conversation Someone is talking to your brand; it's a 1v1 conversation Set expectations with your user Set a voice for your bot Its less about the code and more about the conversation. There are alot of chatbots out there and each one has a specific focus.
